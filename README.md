# Oakland Zoo Empathy Guide Mobile App

This is a mobile app I created for the Oakland Zoo for interal use by the Learning & Engagement Department. Taking the work done by Wilson Sherman, I converted the website into a mobile application to make it easier for staff to access, as well as provide a streamlined view of the website for mobile devices. Oh! Most importantly, there is offline support which should help increase access in the internetless zoo :D

## Important Code Notes

Since this project contains important information that is for zoo staff only, some files are ignored when pushed to Github, namely the Firebase files as well as the ```app.js``` file.

## How it was built!

The project was developed using the [Expo](https://www.expo.dev) framework on React Native. Backend services are provided by [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) and are built natively with [React Native Firebase](https://rnfirebase.io/). While some UI components are hand crafted, others are provided by [RNUI](https://wix.github.io/react-native-ui-lib/).
